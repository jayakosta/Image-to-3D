# 3D Image Processing and Visualization

This project involves the extraction of a 3D model from a 2D image. The process includes removing the background of the image, generating a 3D model from the processed image, and saving both the background-removed image and the 3D model as separate files. The project also integrates visualization functionality to display the 3D model.

## Features

- **Image Background Removal**: Removes the background from the input image using advanced image processing techniques.
- **3D Model Generation**: Converts the processed image into a 3D model and saves it as an OBJ file.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the 3D model using scene viewers.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)
  - `trimesh`
  - `pyopengl`
  - `vtk`
